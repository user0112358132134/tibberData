# tibberData
this project is done to collect and format data from tibber api in bash it is by far not perfect and also not testet in every use case or efficient at all but it works for me. You are free to use it in personal/private non commercial setting if it helps you to manage youre personal tibber data. I cannot guarantee that this works on youre Maschine.
